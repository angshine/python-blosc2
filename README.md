# python-blosc2

This is the home for the Python wrapper for [C-Blosc2](https://github.com/Blosc/c-blosc2).  The goal is to port most (if not all) the API from the existing [python-blosc](https://github.com/Blosc/python-blosc) wrapper for [C-Blosc1](https://github.com/Blosc/c-blosc).  In addition, a new API should be devised for wrapping the new objects and functions in C-Blosc2.  We decided to use [Cython](https://cython.org) for facilitating the creation an object oriented API.

This project is being sponsored by the [Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/psf/).  Thanks!
